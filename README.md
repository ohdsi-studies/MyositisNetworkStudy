=================

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Study Title | Creation and Evaluation of Dermatomyositis Phenotypes Across Different Database Sources         
| Study Status | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Study%20Status-Started-blue.svg" alt="Study Status: Started"> |
| Next Steps | Generate the 8 phenotypes on multiple external OMOP CDMs (at least 1 claims and 1 EHR based CDMs) and run Phevaluator on external CDMs |
| Research Question | How do dermatomyositis phenotypes perform across different data sources (EHR, claims, registries) that may have differences in how the OMOP ETL was performed?Â |
| Uncertainty | We remain uncertain as to how our phenotypes will perform across other database types (claims, other EHR, etc). 
| Study type | Clinical Application. |
